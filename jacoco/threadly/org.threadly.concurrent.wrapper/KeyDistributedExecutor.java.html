/**
 * TaskDistributor is designed such that tasks executed on it for a given key will run in a single 
 * threaded manner.  It needs a multi-threaded pool supplied to it, to then execute those tasks 
 * on.  While the thread which runs those tasks may be different between multiple executions, no 
 * two tasks for the same key will ever be run in parallel.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Because of that, it is recommended that the executor provided has as many possible threads as 
 * possible keys that could be provided to be run in parallel.  If this class is starved for 
 * threads some keys may continue to process new tasks, while other keys could be starved.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Assuming that the shared memory (any objects, primitives, etc) are only accessed through the 
 * same instance of {@link KeyDistributedExecutor}, and assuming that those variables are only 
 * accessed via the same key.  Then the programmer does not need to worry about synchronization, or 
 * volatile.  The {@link KeyDistributedExecutor} will ensure the happens-before relationship.
 * 
 * @since 4.6.0 (since 1.0.0 as org.threadly.concurrent.TaskExecutorDistributor)
