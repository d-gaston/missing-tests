 * of either the creation time, or the last tick time, what ever the most recent point is.  This 
 * allows you to progress time forward faster than it could in real time, having tasks execute 
 * faster, etc, etc.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The tasks in this scheduler are only progressed forward with calls to {@link #tick()}.  Since 
 * it is running on the calling thread, calls to {@code Object.wait()} and {@code Thread.sleep()} 
 * from sub tasks will block (possibly forever).  The call to {@link #tick()} will not unblock 
 * till there is no more work for the scheduler to currently handle.
